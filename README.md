## AlchemicalArrows API ##
If you were using the API from previous versions, you will know that it is very different. You may have found extreme difficulty with the rigidity of the previous API, and this is the reason a rewrite was in order. The new API for AlchemicalArrows 2 will allow for custom external arrows to be created in a much easier way.
